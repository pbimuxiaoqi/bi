# SELECTEDMEASURENAME

Used by expressions for calculation items to determine the measure that is in context by name.
  
## Syntax  
  
```js
SELECTEDMEASURENAME()
```
  
### Parameters  
  
None  
  
## Return value  

A string value holding the name of the measure that is currently in context when the calculation item is evaluated. 

## Remarks

- Can only be referenced in the expression for a calculation item.

- This function is often used for debugging purposes when authoring calculation groups.

## Example  

The following calculation item expression checks if the current measure is Expense Ratio and conditionally applies calculation logic. Since the check is based on a string comparison, it is not subject to formula fixup and will not benefit from object renaming being automatically reflected. For a similar comparison that would benefit from formula fixup, please see the ISSLECTEDMEASURE function instead. 
  
```js
IF (
    SELECTEDMEASURENAME = "Expense Ratio",
    SELECTEDMEASURE (),
    DIVIDE ( SELECTEDMEASURE (), COUNTROWS ( DimDate ) )
)
```
