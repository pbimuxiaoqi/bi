## Syntax  
  
```js
CONTAINS(<table>, <columnName>, <value>[, <columnName>, <value>]â€¦)  
```
  
### Parameters  

|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|table|Any DAX expression that returns a table of data.|  
|columnName|The name of an existing column, using standard DAX syntax. It cannot be an expression. |  
|value|Any DAX expression that returns a single scalar value, that is to be sought in *columnName*. The expression is to be evaluated exactly once and before it is passed to the argument list.  |  

## Return value

A value of **TRUE** if each specified *value* can be found in the corresponding *columnName*, or are contained, in those columns; otherwise, the function returns **FALSE**.  
  
## Remarks  
  
- The arguments *columnName* and *value* must come in pairs; otherwise an error is returned.  
  
- *columnName* must belong to the specified *table*, or to a table that is related to *table*.
