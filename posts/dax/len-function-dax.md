# LEN

Returns the number of characters in a text string.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```dax
LEN(<text>)  
```
  
### Parameters  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|text|The text whose length you want to find, or a column that contains text. Spaces count as characters.|  
  
## Return value

A whole number indicating the number of characters in the text string.  
  
## Remarks

- Whereas Microsoft Excel has different functions for working with single-byte and double-byte character languages, DAX uses Unicode and stores all characters with the same length.  
  
- LEN always counts each character as 1, no matter what the default language setting is.  
  
- If you use LEN with a column that contains non-text values, such as dates or Booleans, the function implicitly casts the value to text, using the current column format.  
  
## Example

The following formula sums the lengths of addresses in the columns, [AddressLine1] and [AddressLine2].  
  
```dax
= LEN([AddressLine1])+LEN([AddressLin2])  
```
