An internal link with display text will get inserted like so: `[[Add aliases to note|alias]]`.

Note: the link to alias is **NOT** inserted as `[[alias]]` for interoperability, so that other software can recognize it as well.

### Find unlinked mentions

After you've set aliases for a note, you can find unlinked mentions by both its name and its aliases.

For example, after setting "AI" as an alias for "Artificial intelligence", you'll see mentions of "AI" in other files in the [[Backlinks]] section.

If you decide to link this mention, a link with display text set to the alias will be created for you. Following the example above, `AI` will become `[[Artificial intelligence|AI]]` once you click on the "Link" button.
